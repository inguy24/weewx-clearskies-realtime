"""UV index smoother — 10-minute rolling average for GET /api/v1/current.

Maintains a fixed-capacity ring buffer for the ``UV`` loop-packet field.
Registered as a packet_tap processor so every loop packet feeds the buffer.
Applied as an enrichment on the ``current`` endpoint to replace the raw UV
value with the smoothed mean.

Buffer capacity assumes ~5-second loop packet intervals (120 samples = 10 min).

SSE path: smoothing is applied to REST only (v0.1).  The SSE broadcast carries
raw loop-packet UV values.  Full SSE smoothing is deferred to a follow-on task.
