"""Scene injection for SSE loop packets (ADR-047).

Called directly from app.py's SSE generator after any unit conversion so the
structured ``scene`` dict is not corrupted by convert_mqtt_packet's float-parse
passthrough for unknown fields.  See app.py for call site.

Every loop packet broadcast over the SSE stream gains a ``scene`` field::

    {
        "sky":     "clear" | "cloudy" | "storm",
        "daytime": bool,
        "overlay": "rain" | "snow" | null,
    }

The scene module maintains server-side state (precip linger timer, almanac
sunrise/sunset).  This module reads that state via ``scene.build_scene()``
and injects it into the packet dict in-place.

Sky label comes from ``sky_condition.classify()`` (local solar analysis).
Night and startup produce None; ``scene._map_sky()`` maps that to "clear" per
ADR-047 §2 (none/unknown → clear fallback).
